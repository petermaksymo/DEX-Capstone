# Project Purpose
This is a final-year undergraduate capstone project at the University of Toronto. 
The goal was to teach our team about developing for the blockchain as well as showcase 
our learnings through a public demo to teach the wider public about Decentralized Exchanges 
and Blockchain. Due to limited resources, the team is aware of severe shortcomings regarding 
the security and dependence on a centralized API for this project. Significant changes would
need to be made to make this a viable DEX. This was strictly intended as a showcase and learning experience.
